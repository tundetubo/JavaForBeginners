An Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 17 Developer has demonstrated proficiency in Java (Standard Edition) software development recognized by a wide range of world-wide industries. They have also exhibited thorough and broad knowledge of the Java programming language, coding practices, and utilization of new features incorporated into Java SE 17. By passing the required exam, a certified individual proves tremendous fluency in Java SE and the acquisition of the valuable professional skills required to be a Java software developer.

#Review all Exam Topics:

##Handling date, time, text, numeric and boolean values

    Use primitives and wrapper classes including Math API, parentheses, type promotion, and casting to evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions
    Manipulate text, including text blocks, using String and StringBuilder classes
    Manipulate date, time, duration, period, instant and time-zone objects using Date-Time API

##Controlling Program Flow

    Create program flow control constructs including if/else, switch statements and expressions, loops, and break and continue statements

##Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach

    Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain the object life-cycle including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection
    Create classes and records, and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers
    Implement overloading, including var-arg methods
    Understand variable scopes, use local variable type inference, apply encapsulation, and make objects immutable
    Implement inheritance, including abstract and sealed classes. Override methods, including that of Object class. Implement polymorphism and differentiate object type versus reference type. Perform type casting, identify object types using instanceof operator and pattern matching
    Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods
    Create and use enumerations with fields, methods and constructors

##Handling Exceptions

    Handle exceptions using try/catch/finally, try-with-resources, and multi-catch blocks, including custom exceptions

##Working with Arrays and Collections

    Create Java arrays, List, Set, Map, and Deque collections, and add, remove, update, retrieve and sort their elements

##Working with Streams and Lambda expressions

    Use Java object and primitive Streams, including lambda expressions implementing functional interfaces, to supply, filter, map, consume, and sort data
    Perform decomposition, concatenation and reduction, and grouping and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams

##Packaging and deploying Java code and use the Java Platform Module System

    Define modules and their dependencies, expose module content including for reflection. Define services, producers, and consumers
    Compile Java code, produce modular and non-modular jars, runtime images, and implement migration using unnamed and automatic modules

##Managing concurrent code execution

    Create worker threads using Runnable and Callable, manage the thread lifecycle, including automations provided by different Executor services and concurrent API
    Develop thread-safe code, using different locking mechanisms and concurrent API
    Process Java collections concurrently including the use of parallel streams

##Using Java I/O API

    Read and write console and file data using I/O Streams
    Serialize and de-serialize Java objects
    Create, traverse, read, and write Path objects and their properties using java.nio.file API

##Accessing databases using JDBC

    Create connections, create and execute basic, prepared and callable statements, process query results and control transactions using JDBC API

##Implementing Localization

    Implement localization using locales, resource bundles, parse and format messages, dates, times, and numbers including currency and percentage values

##Assume the following:

    Missing package and import statements: If sample code do not include package or import statements, and the question does not explicitly refer to these missing statements, then assume that all sample code is in the same package, or import statements exist to support them.
    No file or directory path names for classes: If a question does not state the file names or directory locations of classes, then assume one of the following, whichever will enable the code to compile and run:
        All classes are in one file
        Each class is contained in a separate file, and all files are in one directory
    Unintended line breaks: Sample code might have unintended line breaks. If you see a line of code that looks like it has wrapped, and this creates a situation where the wrapping is significant (for example, a quoted String literal has wrapped), assume that the wrapping is an extension of the same line, and the line does not contain a hard carriage return that would cause a compilation failure.
    Code fragments: A code fragment is a small section of source code presented without its context. Assume that all necessary supporting code exists and that the supporting environment fully supports the correct compilation and execution of the code shown and its omitted environment.
    Descriptive comments: Take descriptive comments, such as "setter and getters go here," at face value. Assume that correct code exists, compiles, and runs successfully to create the described effect.

##Candidates are also expected to:

    Understand the basics of Java Logging API.
    Use Annotations such as Override, Functionalnterface, Deprecated, SuppressWarnings, and SafeVarargs.
    Use generics, including wildcards.
